 Click [Arithmetic Portal](http://harambe4vp.azurewebsites.net/) to play this game.


### Rules of Game
  * Player Starts the game at White tile (Bottom-left Corner).
  * 'X' represents player's current position in your grid.
  * Player Wins the game as soon as he/she reaches the Black Tile (Top-Left Corner).
  * A random expression is generated every T seconds(T = 30 sec for level 1 and T = 60sec for level 2)
  * For every correct answer the distance moved by the player is determined by how fast the player   
      gives the answer.
  * Player can move a maxmimum of 6 tiles.
  * If the player gets a green portal on his way he gets transported to the next row green portal.
  * If the player gives a wrong answer and there is a red portal in the next 6 tiles the player will be 
      transported to red portal in the previous row. So the player needs to answer the question carefully
      to avoid falling down.
  * If the player gives a wrong answer and there is no red portal with 6 tiles ,then he will not move.

### Future Plans
  * Making the Game Competitive 
    (Option of a 2 Player Game so that winning the game becomes the motivation for doing calculations fastly)
  * At Present, the Target Audience is only kids. We will extend this to high school guys by focussing on more complex          mathematical operations like 
    Integration , Differentation ,Algebra . This extension will increase the scope of this app by a huge margin. 
  * Techinques like ABACUS,VEDIC MATHS can be integrated as they provide you ways for rapid speed in calculations.
  * For Kids of KinderGarten , Number Tables can be taught through this and by making the site more kid-friendly.
  * Adding More Levels and a Score-HighScore system.
