			<b style = "color: "> Instructions </b></br>
			  * Player Starts the game at White tile (Bottom-left Corner)<br>
			  * 'X' represents player's current position in your grid<br>
			  * Player Wins the game as soon as he/she reaches the Black Tile (Top-Left Corner)<br>
			  * A random expression is generated every T seconds(T = 30 sec for level 1 and T = 60sec for level 2)<br>
			  * For every correct answer the distance moved by the player is determined by how fast the player   
			      gives the answer<br>
			  * Player can move a maxmimum of 6 tiles<br>
			  * If the player gets a green portal on his way he gets transported to the next row green portal<br>
			  * If the player gives a wrong answer and there is a red portal in the next 6 tiles the player will be 
			      transported to red portal in the previous row<br> So the player needs to answer the question carefully
			      to avoid falling down<br>
			  * If the player gives a wrong answer and there is no red portal with 6 tiles ,then he will not move<br>
